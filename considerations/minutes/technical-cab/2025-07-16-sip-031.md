## 2025-07-16 Meeting Notes

The Technical CAB met to consider SIP-031.

**Technical Discussion Summary**

The Technical CAB reviewed the technical details and implementation plan for SIP-031 as outlined in [PR #214](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/214). The discussion focused on the following key areas:

- **Boot Contract Design:** Members discussed the minimal boot contract approach, which enables the emission of new STX to a designated recipient address. The contract supports recipient rotation via a simple `update-recipient` function, allowing for signer set changes without requiring additional hard forks. The contract also includes `get-recipient` and `claim` functions for transparency and operational simplicity.

- **Security and Auditability:** There was consensus on the importance of on-chain auditability for all mint and unlock events. The design ensures that every emission is accompanied by an on-chain receipt, and the logic is intentionally simple to minimize attack surface and implementation risk.

- **Multisig Recipient and Governance:** The initial recipient is a 3-of-5 multisig derived from Treasury Committee pubkeys. The process for rotating signers was discussed, with agreement that the contractâ€™s upgradability for recipient changes (without further forks) is a critical feature for operational flexibility and security.

- **Emission Schedule and Economic Impact:** The emission scheduleâ€”100M STX at activation, 100M STX unlocked over 24 months, and 300M STX distributed over 60 monthsâ€”was reviewed. Members discussed the inflationary impact, with modeling showing a projected ~5.75% annualized inflation rate. The group acknowledged the tradeoff between ecosystem funding and inflation, and agreed the schedule is within acceptable bounds.

- **Implementation Details and Open Questions:** The CAB noted that the contract code is still to be finalized, and implementation details (such as error handling, edge cases, and integration with PoX) will require further review. There was a request for clear documentation and test coverage before mainnet deployment.

- **Consensus:** No major technical objections were raised. The CAB agreed that the proposed design is sound, with appropriate safeguards and flexibility. The group recommended proceeding with implementation, subject to final code review and testing.

**Summary:** The CABâ€™s technical review found the SIP-031 boot contract design and emission schedule to be robust, auditable, and operationally flexible, with no blocking technical issues identified in the PR discussion.
