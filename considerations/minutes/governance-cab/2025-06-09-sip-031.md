## 2025-06-09 Meeting Notes

The Governance CAB met to review SIP-031. The group supports the proposal's goal of accelerating ecosystem growth and focused on key areas where more detail would strengthen community support.

Key points discussed:

- The proposed Treasury and Appointments Committees are seen as a positive step.
- More clarity is needed on operational details for these new committees, including selection and voting processes.
- The group agrees that strong, ongoing community oversight will be important for the new entities.
- Ensuring meaningful community representation on the new committees is considered essential.
- The CAB appreciates that the Endowment will not vote its STX and discussed how to best align the treasury's influence with community priorities.

The CAB has the following questions for the SIP authors to help clarify the proposal for the community:

- What are the Treasury Committee's internal decision-making and voting rules?
- What are the plans for ongoing community engagement and feedback after the SIP passes?
- Can the roles of 'keyholder' versus 'rotating' members be further defined?
