## Meeting Notes

The governance CAB was requested to review SIP-034 as a rider to SIP-033. Items discussed:

- SIP-034 is summarized as an "under-the-hood" performance improvement that helps with a major use case behind SIP-033
- last time a rider was introduced was SIP-020 Bitwise Ops on SIP-015 Stacks 2.1
- following SIP-020 approval the Governance CAB requested any riders be known before the vote
- we agree sufficient notice was given for this rider and that it follows the same activation pattern
- we still recommend the technical CAB makes an updated review and activation is contingent upon their approval

## Vote Outcome(s)

Quorum is reached with 5 of 6 eligible CAB members voting on the SIP.
