## Biographies

**AcrossFire**: AcrossFire has experience as a DevOps engineer, Linux enthusiast, and a passionate Bitcoiner. He has experience with systems administration and enjoys automating maintenance tasks using tools like Puppet, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes and others. He likes to bring this experience to Bitcoin by running Bitcoin and Stacks nodes and doing what he can to optimize the experience.

**Algorithm**: Currently serving at Secret Key Lab/ Xverse.
Advocating for Stacks tech to fully inherit Bitcoin hash power where an individual can have full ownership of their identity.

**Binaya Tripathi**: Binaya is a data scientist and Clarity Developer. Binaya is currently based in San Francisco and owns and operates a small hospitality business. He has been involved in the Bitcoin and Stacks and web 3.0 ecosystem for the last 2.5 years. He is actively trying to build bitcoin builders ecosystem in San Francisco and in Nepal in collaboration with local builders in Nepal. 

**cargocult**: Software Engineer, C/C++/Clojure/Clarity - former software engineer for a variety of trading companies over a 10+ year period.  Currently working in a more traditional software engineering role using Clojure/Scala.  Given my background, I have a fair amount of knowledge of the technical and practical functioning of electronic capital marketplaces.  Beyond advancing the general BTC/STX ecosystem, my main area of interest revolves around how these technologies interest with traditional finance systems.

**Cryptocracy.btc**: I have been working with Stacks since 2016. Developed previous projects on older versions of Blockstack, was among the first developers to implement sending BTC by Name. Aside from the long history with developing with Stacks, I also worked as an admin of an ISP and telephone company for the greater part of a decade. Currently working with other developers to integrate existing functionality such as Mining and Stacking in the Derupt application.

**Cyle.btc**: Tech-interested since a young age, started developing at 11yrs old and never stopped. Extensive experience in architecture, infrastructure (networking, servers & cloud), and many years of professional programming experience. I have spent my last 10 years with more focus on IT management, however I constantly find myself drawn back to “the source”.  Relatively new to the crypto ecosystem, however, I believe strongly in its associated fundamentals. While there are a number of smart contract languages available on various blockchains, the potential that Stacks brings, being based on Bitcoin, has enticed me to become more involved in the project.

**dartman.btc**: Blockstack's commitment to the "can't do evil" ethos caught dartman's attention, leading him to explore smart contract development with enthusiasm. His interest in smart contract development grew exponentially after discovering the power of Clarity and the value of the supportive community. As an active contributor to the Stacks ecosystem, he is eager to continue supporting the community and contributing to SIPs to make a positive impact.

**DeeList**: DeeList is a strong proponent and early adopter of blockchain technology, placing a high value on open source projects, community involvement, web3 content generation, hardware and mining.

**j2p2**: Computer Engineer, Clarity Developer. Won First and Second place in Clarity Course Cohort #2 Hackathon. Before joining the Stacks ecosystem, worked 18+ years building software for wireless communication systems products. 

**Jackbinswitch.btc**: A crypto enthusiast/trader since 2017, and a full-time Registered Nurse currently working in palliative/hospice care for the terminally ill. Upon discovering the Stacks ecosystem in 2022, Jack has become a prominent member of Stacks Twitter. In addition to trading, and fiat mining, Jack has spent the last year primarily writing about Stacks on Sigle. Recently Jack joined the Flagship.FYI team as the Captain of their Stacks outpost. This position entails keeping their community fully appraised of the newest developments on the Stacks blockchain. 

**Kaylee Fort**: Kayla, also known as Kaylee, serves as the Community Growth Lead at Xverse, she is also a Bitcoin educator and content creator, where she contributes to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While previously specializing in Medical Simulation at Johns Hopkins University, she has been actively involved in Bitcoin education and participating in Stacks community events. Kaylee spent over 5 years as a Simulation Specialist I, before transitioning her career to join the Xverse team to help shape the future of Bitcoin. 

**Marshall**: Marshall earns his living as a warehouse associate and forklift driver. He spends his spare time in the evenings and weekends enveloped in the Stacks ecosystem, tinkering with his nodes and talking shop with Pomeranian.btc.
Marshall fell in love with Stacks when he learned that the mission from the beginning (even before the 2.0 launch) was to build a decentralized internet where users take back control from Web2 giants like Facebook and Google. These companies shouldn’t be allowed to say whether or not they “want” to be evil, as Google’s infamous tagline was “Don’t be evil.” Rather, the tagline should be “Can’t be evil,” as Muneeb so aptly put it.
Marshall’s top core skills include his curiosity, problem solving / critical thinking, and written communication. He joined the Stacks ecosystem in February 2021 and never looked back. He graduated from Clarity Cohort 5 in 2022, he’s now excited to begin contributing to the SIP process, and he hopes to eventually ditch his forklift to contribute to the ecosystem full-time.

**Mistiff**: Mistiff has extensive experience managing online communities and a track record of success in creating and fostering them. With immense experience in social media and online marketing, he is well-versed in what it takes to attract and keep a wide variety of consumers in the web3 space. Mistiff is skilled in creating and putting into action, plans for online communities that promote a sense of belonging. He is adept at facilitating talks, handling disputes, and encouraging productive interactions. Mistiff is skilled at using data and analytics to monitor a community's development and progress and to spot areas for improvement. Mistiff is an outstanding communicator and problem-solver in addition to his knowledge of community administration. Mistiff is currently managing multiple web3 communities inside and outside the Stacks ecosystem. He is also a Stacks advocate. Mistiff joined the Stacks ecosystem back in June 2022.

**Rafael Cárdenas**: Rafael is a Staff Software Engineer at Hiro, focused on building and maintaining Hiro’s API infrastructure which includes the Stacks Blockchain API, Ordinals API, Token Metadata API and others, all of which power dozens of apps and wallets built on Stacks and Bitcoin. Rafael has also been an active member and contributor of the Stacks ecosystem since 2021, involved with the development of the core blockchain through the SIP process and participating as a reviewer at the Stacks Accelerator.

**Sleepi**: I am a study coordinator in the medical/pharmacy research with a strong passion for cryptocurrency, having become fascinated with its dynamic nature through day trading. As a community representative, I am committed to educating and supporting others and ensuring fair representation for all members. While valuing privacy, I continue to expand my knowledge in this rapidly-evolving industry and am open to connecting with others to discuss all things crypto. I am an active moderator and support in the official Stacks discord server.

**Tigs / Oli**: tigs / Oli: Yo! The name is tigs and have been a multiplayer pro gamer since the early 90s. Not quite so pro anymore but through this exposure I taught myself Cisco (CCNA) and server administration at a young age. I haven't passed high school (got a GED), have attended college for gaming dev but never completed and have been involved in a few jobs in regards to teaching, inspiring and getting aspiring tech people into the industry as whole. Call me a Jack of all trades. Master of none! I am deeply involved with Horticulture as well (green fingers). I run several bitcoin+lightning nodes, a few miners and am deeply interested in Bitcoin as a saver of humanity, not purely as an investment vehicle. I am also involved with TSOBTC (The School of BTC).

**Werner.btc**: Works for the Hiro Wallet team as support lead, helping users with issues related to the wallet and transactions. Likes to think about ways to improve Stacks, and dapps in the ecosystem.

## About this SIP Editor Committee

The role of the SIP Editors is to identify SIPs in the Draft status that can be transitioned to Accepted status. A SIP editor must be able to vet a SIP to ensure that it is well-formed, that it follows the ratification workflow faithfully, and that it does not overlap with any already-Accepted SIPs or SIPs that have since become Recommended or Ratified.

The SIP Editors are responsible for maintaining the "inbound funnel" for SIPs from the greater Stacks community. SIP Editors ensure that all inbound SIPs are well-formed, relevant, and do not duplicate prior work (including rejected SIPs).

SIP Editors should be open and welcoming towards enthusiastic users who want to help improve the greater Stacks ecosystem. As such, SIP Editors should encourage users to submit SIPs if they have good ideas that may be worth implementing.

In addition, SIP Editors should respond to public requests for help from community members who want to submit a SIP. They may point them towards this document, or towards other supplemental documents and tools to help them get started.
