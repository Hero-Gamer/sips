# Introduction

Provide a high-level summary of the problem(s) that this SIP proposes to solve, as well as a high-level description of how the proposal solves them. This section shall emphasize its novel contributions, and briefly describe how they address the problem(s). Any motivational arguments and example problems and solutions belong in this section.

# Specification

Provide the detailed technical specification. It may include code snippets, diagrams, performance evaluations, and other supplemental data to justify particular design decisions. However, a copy of all external supplemental data (such as links to research papers) must be included with the SIP, and must be made available under an approved copyright license.

# Backwards Compatibility

Address any backwards-incompatiblity concerns that may arise with the implementation of this SIP, as well as describe (or reference) technical mitigations for breaking changes. This section may be left blank for non-technical SIPs.

# Related Work

Summarize alternative solutions that address the same or similar problems, and briefly describe why they are not adequate solutions. This section may reference alternative solutions in other blockchain projects, in research papers from academia and industry, other open-source projects, and so on. This section must be accompanied by a bibliography of sufficient detail such that someone reading the SIP can find and evaluate the related works.

# Activation

Describe the timeline, falsifiable criteria, and process for activating the SIP once it is ratified.

# Reference Implementation

One or more references to one or more production-quality implementations of the SIP, if applicable. This section is only informative — the SIP ratification process is independent of any engineering processes (or other processes) that would be followed to produce implementations.
