# Introduction

The Clarity smart contract language powers decentralized applications across a
wide range of domains. Over years of real-world use, developers have encountered
several pain points when interacting with other, sometimes untrusted, contracts.
Securely calling unknown contracts unlocks powerful use cases, but demands
careful safeguards.

This SIP addresses common feedback and requests from builders in the ecosystem.
It proposes new Clarity features to make it easier for developers to write
secure and composable smart contracts. Specifically, it proposes:

1. **A new Clarity function to fetch the hash of a contract's code body.** This
   enables on-chain contract code validation, for example allowing contract A to
   validate that contract B follows a specific template and is therefore safe to
   interact with. This is especially useful for enabling bridges and
   marketplaces to safely and trustlessly support a dynamic set of assets.
2. **A new set of Clarity functions to allow a contract to set post-conditions
   to protect its assets.** These allow a contract to safely call arbitrary
   external contracts (e.g. passed in as traits) while ensuring that if the
   executed code moves assets beyond those specified, the changes will be rolled
   back.
3. **A new Clarity function to convert simple values into `string-ascii`
   values.** This function will enable developers to easily convert values like
   `bool`s and `principal`s into their ASCII string representations,
   facilitating the generation of string-based messages for interacting with
   cross-chain protocols.

# Specification

## Fetching the hash of a contract body: `contract-hash?`

Originally proposed [here](https://github.com/clarity-lang/reference/issues/88).

`contract-hash?` returns, on success, the SHA-512/256 hash of the code body of
the contract principal specified as input. This is useful to prove that a
deployed contract follows a specific template.

- **Input**: `principal`
- **Output**: `(response (buff 32) uint)`
- **Signature**: `(contract-hash? contract-principal)`
- **Description**: Returns the SHA-512/256 hash of the code body of the contract
  principal specified as input, or an error if the principal is not a contract
  or the specified contract does not exist. Returns:
  - `(ok 0x<hash>)`, where `<hash>` is the SHA-512/256 hash of the code body, on
    success
  - `(err u1)` if the principal is not a contract principal
  - `(err u2)` if the specified contract does not exist
- **Example**:
  ```clarity
  (contract-hash? 'SP2QEZ06AGJ3RKJPBV14SY1V5BBFNAW33D96YPGZF.BNS-V2) ;; Returns (ok 0x9f8104ff869aba1205cd5e15f6404dd05675f4c3fe0817c623c425588d981c2f)
  ```

## Limiting asset access: `restrict-assets?`

Originally proposed [here](https://github.com/clarity-lang/reference/issues/64).

`restrict-assets?` establishes a context with a deny-all outflow policy for a
specific principal during the evaluation of its body expressions. It accepts a
set of allowances, defined using `with-stx`, `with-ft`, `with-nft`, and
`with-stacking`, which selectively grant outflow allowances. After the body
expressions finish, the Clarity VM checks the **gross** outflow from the scoped
principal against the granted allowances. If any allowance is exceeded,
`restrict-assets?` returns an error; otherwise, it returns `ok` with the result
of the last body expression.

The most important use case of these new builtins is to allow a contract to
protect its own assets. To ensure that the contract's assets are safe by
default, the new `as-contract?` expression is similar to the existing
`as-contract` expression, but will implicitly behave as though there is a
`restrict-assets?` expression around its body, specifying the contract principal
as the asset owner. The old `as-contract` is no longer available in Clarity 4.
Similar to `restrict-assets?`, `as-contract?` accepts a set of `with-stx`,
`with-ft`, `with-nft`, and `with-stacking` expressions which selectively grant
outflow allowances from the contract's assets.

- `with-stx` grants an outflow allowance for a specific amount of STX via calls
  to the `stx-transfer?` function.
- `with-ft` grants an outflow allowance for a specific amount of the specified
  fungible token.
- `with-nft` grants an outflow allowance for a specific identifier of the
  specified NFT.
- `with-stacking` grants an outflow allowance for a specific amount of STX via
  calls to the `stack-stx` or `delegate-stx` functions of the active PoX
  contract.

Use of `with-stx`, `with-ft`, `with-nft`, or `with-stacking` outside of
`restrict-assets?` or `as-contract?` results in an analysis error.

- `restrict-assets?`

  - **Input**:
    - `asset-owner`: `principal`: The principal whose assets are being
      protected.
    - `((with-stx|with-ft|with-nft|with-stacking)*)`: The set of allowances to
      grant during the evaluation of the body expressions.
    - `AnyType* A`: The Clarity expressions to be executed within the context,
      with the final expression returning type `A`, where `A` is not a
      `response`
  - **Output**: `(response A int)`
  - **Signature**:
    `(restrict-assets? asset-owner ((with-stx|with-ft|with-nft|with-stacking)*) expr-body1 expr-body2 ... expr-body-last)`
  - **Description**: Executes the body expressions, then checks the asset
    outflows against the granted allowances, in declaration order. If any
    allowance is violated, the body expressions are reverted, an error is
    returned, and an event is emitted with the full details of the violation to
    help with debugging. Note that the `asset-owner` and allowance setup
    expressions are evaluated before executing the body expressions. The final
    body expression cannot return a `response` value in order to avoid returning
    a nested `response` value from the `restrict-assets?` (nested responses are
    error-prone). Returns:

    - `(ok x)` if the outflows are within the allowances, where `x` is the
      result of the `body` expression and has type `A`.
    - `(err index)` if an allowance was violated, where `index` is the 0-based
      index of the first violated allowance in the list of granted allowances,
      or -1 if an asset with no allowance caused the violation.

  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (define-public (foo)
      (restrict-assets? tx-sender ()
        (try! (stx-transfer? u1000000 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM))
      )
    ) ;; Returns (err -1)
    (define-public (bar)
      (restrict-assets? tx-sender ()
        (+ u1 u2)
      )
    ) ;; Returns (ok u3)
    ```

- `with-stx`

  - **Input**:
    - `amount`: `uint`: The amount of uSTX to grant access to.
  - **Output**: Not applicable
  - **Signature**: `(with-stx amount)`
  - **Description**: Adds an outflow allowance for `amount` uSTX from the
    `asset-owner` of the enclosing `restrict-assets?` or `as-contract?`
    expression.
  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-stx u1000000))
      (try! (stx-transfer? u2000000 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM))
    ) ;; Returns (err 0)
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-stx u1000000))
      (try! (stx-transfer? u1000000 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM))
    ) ;; Returns (ok true)
    ```

- `with-ft`

  - **Input**:
    - `contract-id`: `principal`: The contract defining the FT asset.
    - `token-name`: `(string-ascii 128)`: The name of the FT or `"*"` for any FT
      defined in `contract-id`.
    - `amount`: `uint`: The amount of FT to grant access to.
  - **Output**: Not applicable
  - **Signature**: `(with-ft contract-id token-name amount)`
  - **Description**: Adds an outflow allowance for `amount` of the fungible
    token defined in `contract-id` with name `token-name` from the `asset-owner`
    of the enclosing `restrict-assets?` or `as-contract?` expression. Note,
    `token-name` should match the name used in the `define-fungible-token` call
    in the contract.
  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-ft (contract-of token-trait) "stackaroo" u50))
      (try! (contract-call? token-trait transfer u100 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM none))
      ) ;; Returns (err 0)
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-ft (contract-of token-trait) "stackaroo" u50))
      (try! (contract-call? token-trait transfer u20 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM none))
    ) ;; Returns (ok true)
    ```

- `with-nft`

  - **Input**:
    - `contract-id`: `principal`: The contract defining the NFT asset.
    - `token-name`: `(string-ascii 128)`: The name of the NFT or `"*"` for any

    - `identifier`: `T`: The identifier of the token to grant access to.
  - **Output**: Not applicable
  - **Signature**: `(with-nft contract-id token-name identifier)`
  - **Description**: Adds an outflow allowance for the non-fungible token
    identified by `identifier` defined in `contract-id` with name `token-name`
    from the `asset-owner` of the enclosing `restrict-assets?` or `as-contract?`
    expression. Note, `token-name` should match the name used in the
    `define-non-fungible-token` call in the contract.
  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-nft (contract-of nft-trait) "stackaroo" u123))
      (try! (contract-call? nft-trait transfer u4 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM))
    ) ;; Returns (err 0)
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-nft (contract-of nft-trait) "stackaroo" u123))
      (try! (contract-call? nft-trait transfer u123 tx-sender 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM))
    ) ;; Returns (ok true)
    ```

- `with-stacking`

  - **Input**:
    - `amount`: `uint`: The amount of uSTX that can be locked.
  - **Output**: Not applicable
  - **Signature**: `(with-stacking amount)`
  - **Description**: Adds a stacking allowance for `amount` uSTX from the
    `asset-owner` of the enclosing `restrict-assets?` or `as-contract?`
    expression. This restricts calls to `delegate-stx` and `stack-stx` in the
    active PoX contract to lock up to the amount of uSTX specified.
  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-stacking u1000000000000))
      (try! (contract-call? 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.pox-4 delegate-stx
        u1100000000000 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM none none
      ))
    ) ;; Returns (err 0)
    (restrict-assets? tx-sender
      ((with-stacking u1000000000000))
      (try! (contract-call? 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.pox-4 delegate-stx
        u900000000000 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM none none
      ))
    ) ;; Returns (ok true)
    ```

- `as-contract?`

  - **Input**:
    - `((with-stx|with-ft|with-nft|with-stacking)*)`: The set of allowances to
      grant during the evaluation of the body expressions.
    - `AnyType* A`: The Clarity expressions to be executed within the context,
      with the final expression returning type `A`, where `A` is not a
      `response`
  - **Output**: `(response A int)`
  - **Signature**:
    `(as-contract? ((with-stx|with-ft|with-nft|with-stacking)*) expr-body1 expr-body2 ... expr-body-last)`
  - **Description**: Switches the current context's `tx-sender` and
    `contract-caller` values to the contract's principal and executes the body
    expressions within that context, then checks the asset outflows from the
    contract against the granted allowances, in declaration order. If any
    allowance is violated, the body expressions are reverted, an error is
    returned, and an event is emitted with the full details of the violation to
    help with debugging. Note that the allowance setup expressions are evaluated
    before executing the body expressions. The final body expression cannot
    return a `response` value in order to avoid returning a nested `response`
    value from the `restrict-assets?` (nested responses are error-prone).
    Returns:

    - `(ok x)` if the outflows are within the allowances, where `x` is the
      result of the `body` expression and has type `A`.
    - `(err index)` if an allowance was violated, where `index` is the 0-based
      index of the first violated allowance in the list of granted allowances,
      or -1 if an asset with no allowance caused the violation.

  - **Example**:
    ```clarity
    (define-public (foo)
      (as-contract? ()
        (try! (stx-transfer? u1000000 tx-sender recipient))
      )
    ) ;; Returns (err -1)
    (define-public (bar)
      (as-contract? ((with-stx u1000000))
        (try! (stx-transfer? u1000000 tx-sender recipient))
      )
    ) ;; Returns (ok true)
    ```

## Conversion to `string-ascii`: `to-ascii?`

Originally proposed [here](https://github.com/clarity-lang/reference/issues/82).

`to-ascii?` is a new Clarity function that converts simple values into their
`string-ascii` representations.

- **Input**: `int` | `uint` | `bool` | `principal` | `(buff 524284)` |
  `(string-utf8 1048571)`
- **Output**: `(response (string-ascii 1048571) uint)`
- **Signature**: `(to-ascii? value)`
- **Description**: Returns the `string-ascii` representation of the input value
  in an `ok` response on success. The only error condition is if the input type
  is `string-utf8` and the value contains non-ASCII characters, in which case,
  `(err u1)` is returned.
- **Example**:
  ```clarity
  (to-ascii? true) ;; Returns (ok "true")
  (to-ascii? 42) ;; Returns (ok "42")
  (to-ascii? 'SP2QEZ06AGJ3RKJPBV14SY1V5BBFNAW33D96YPGZF) ;; Returns (ok "SP2QEZ06AGJ3RKJPBV14SY1V5BBFNAW33D96YPGZF")
  (to-ascii? 0x12345678) ;; Returns (ok "0x12345678")
  ```
