### Key Contributors

* Streamlined structure that frees the most impactful contributors to contribute to a wider scope for the project.  
* Eliminates structural blockers tied to legacy compliance burdens.

* Unlocks participation in marketing, token incentives, and integrations.  
* Freedom to focus on execution  
* Clarity on scope and roles across new operational entity, the Stacks Foundation, and the Stacks Endowment.  
* Ability to scale faster thanks to larger and more predictable budget flows.  
* Stronger accountability and feedback loops via SIP-driven funding renewals.  
* More talent attraction and retention with access to funding, stability, and runway.  
* Strategic resource coordination across contributors (e.g., global GTM team, sBTC rollout).  
* Examples like the Optimism Foundation show how consolidated treasuries empower execution.

### Key Partners (Exchanges, Custodians, Oracles, Wallets, and Other Infra Participants)

* Faster integration timelines due to a unified core team responsible for protocol upgrades, support, and testing.  
* Improved reliability and confidence in roadmap delivery via public commitments and long-term funding.  
* Dedicated support for integrations (e.g., funding for dev time, audits, or infrastructure deployment).  
* Expanded market activity from treasury-backed growth campaigns (e.g., new STX/sBTC listings, liquidity incentives).  
* Lower organizational complexity when negotiating integration, marketing, or technical agreements.  
* Active liquidity and incentive support to boost usage post-integration (especially valuable for exchanges and wallets).  
* Stronger long-term alignment between infrastructure partners and ecosystem growth priorities.  
* Greater brand lift as Stacks expands visibility and market cap, helping partners benefit from being early or core participants.

### Casual Holders

* Clear understanding of who does what in the ecosystem and where/how to get involved  
* Increased token utility and use cases resulting in a stronger, more valuable ecosystem.
